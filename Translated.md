```
In the ropes of religion, devotional flowers,
I did a necklace,
Throw your throat, to lengthen,
Double up. ... (1)

Which way is it, which way is it,
I couldn't find why,
So many temples, standing that,
Where are the cows? ... (2)

In what word shall I call thee,
Say, O landlord,
What practice do I have to do,
Or a bright house. ... (3)

The world has given, is there,
I said in my mouth,
That's why you, merciful ice,
It's raining cats and dogs. ... (4)

Don't go away, I can't find it,
From the wrong to you,
The thorns are bent, and the stalks fall off.
The pain is mine. ... (5)

When the wind came, the bike was scared,
Sit down and sit down,
I am astonished at the ignorant, my soul,
Looking down, your arms are down. ... (6)

I'm not looking for you,
Not lucky to find,
Dahle sells, then under Pankaj,
I beg you. ... (7)
